Rotary Encoder Library for Arduino
----------------------------------

This is an adaptation of Ben Buxton's excellent 
[rotary library](http://www.buxtronix.net/2011/10/rotary-encoders-done-properly.html)
and implements additional features for encoder rotation speed.

Original library copyright 2011 Ben Buxton. Licensed under the GNU GPL Version 3.
Contact: bb@cactii.net

Features
--------
- Debounce handling with support for high rotation speeds
- Correctly handles direction changes mid-step
- Checks for valid state changes for more robust counting and noise immunity
- Counts full-steps (default) or half-steps
- Calculates speed of rotation

\page pageBackground Detecting an Encoder's Rotation
_This great explanation is reproduced from Ben Buxton's example code._

A typical mechanical rotary encoder emits a two bit gray code on 3 output pins.
Every step in the output (often accompanied by a physical 'click') generates a 
specific sequence of output codes on the pins.

There are 3 pins used for the rotary encoding - one common and two 'bit' pins
(called A and B).

The following is the typical sequence of codes output when moving from one 
step to the next:

Position | Bit1| Bit2|
--------:|:---:|:---:|
Step1    |  0  |  0  |
  1/4    |  1  |  0  |
  1/2    |  1  |  1  |
  3/4    |  0  |  1  |
Step2    |  0  |  0  |

From this table, we can see that when moving from one 'click' to the next, 
there are 4 changes in the output code. 

- From an initial 0 - 0, Bit1 goes high, Bit0 stays low.
- Then both bits are high, halfway through the step.
- Then Bit1 goes low, but Bit2 stays high.
- Finally at the end of the step, both bits return to 0.

Detecting the direction is easy - the table simply goes in the other direction
(read up instead of down).

To decode this, we use a simple state machine. Every time the output code changes,
it follows state, until finally a full steps worth of code is received (in the 
correct order). At the final 0-0, it returns a value indicating a step in one 
direction or the other.

It's also possible to use 'half-step' mode. This just emits an event at both the 
0-0 and 1-1 positions. This might be useful for some encoders where you want to 
detect all positions. In MD_REncoder.h set ENABLE_HALF_STEP to 1 to enable 
half-step mode.

If an invalid state happens (for example we go from '0-1' straight to '1-0'), the 
state machine resets to the start until 0-0 and the next valid codes occur.

The biggest advantage of using a state machine over other algorithms is that this 
has inherent debounce built in. Other algorithms emit spurious output with switch 
bounce, but this one will simply flip between sub-states until the bounce settles, 
then continue along the state machine. A side effect of debounce is that fast 
rotations can cause steps to be skipped. By not requiring debounce, fast rotations 
can be accurately measured. Another advantage is the ability to properly handle bad 
state, such as due to EMI, etc. It is also a lot simpler than others - a static 
state table and less than 10 lines of logic.

Compile Time Switches
---------------------

ENABLE_HALF_STEP is 0 by default. Set this to 1 to emit codes when the rotary encoder
is at 11 as well as 00. The default is to emit codes only at 00.

ENABLE_PULLUPS is set to 1 by default. Set this 0 if internal pullup resistors on the
input pins are not required.

ENABLE_SPEED is set to 1 by default. Set this to 0 to disable the code and storage used to 
calculate the speed of the encoder rotation.

Speed Calculation
-----------------
The number of clicks is accumulated during the period defined by setPeriod(). Once the time 
has expired the velocity is calculated in clicks per second by multiplying the number of 
clicks by the number of periods in a second.

speed = ClickCount * (1000 / period)
